# Certifier
![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/MikaelSvenn/Certifier)

A fully BouncyCastle-based study for creating asymmetric keys, signatures, certificates and such. Not reviewed by any security professional, and thus probably completely insecure.

Should not be used for anything real.
